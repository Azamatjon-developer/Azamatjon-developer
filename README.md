👋 About Me

Frontend Developer specializing in React and Next.js, with a strong focus on clean code, clear user interfaces, and solid fundamentals.

I currently work as a Frontend Developer at U Tech Pro Solutions, where I build scalable and maintainable web applications. Alongside this, I am a Mentor at Mars IT School, teaching frontend development to students from beginner to advanced levels and helping them build strong foundations in modern web technologies.

I am a lifelong learner who values continuous growth. I regularly read technical and self-development books, believing that strong thinking and discipline are just as important as technical skills in the long run.

Languages: Uzbek — Native , Russian — B2 , English — B2


Soft Skills:

Strong sense of responsibility

Ability to explain complex topics in a simple and practical way

Calm and focused approach to problem-solving

I believe in steady progress, honest work, and building skills that stand the test of time.
